#Minimal Feedback Full UI

A GraphQL API for managing user feedback with a simple web interface. Built with Express and MongoDB, this project supports creating, viewing, and deleting feedback, along with user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The API is accessible via a GraphQL endpoint, and the frontend includes pages for feedback submission, login, and admin functionality.
